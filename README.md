# Spotify Clone

## Introduction

Everyone likes music, right? Odds are if you do, you've heard of Spotify. Today we're going to copy an older (and simpler) version of the Spotify home page.

All of the necessary assets and images are included in the starter code.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- [Fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
- Clone this repo into your `~/code/labs`
- You must use 1 descendant selector, and 1 multi selector. You can use more.
- Animate the green Spotify logo in the upper left-hand corner to jump up and down when a user hovers over it.

#### Starter code

The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and a css file is created in `main.css` with colors.
